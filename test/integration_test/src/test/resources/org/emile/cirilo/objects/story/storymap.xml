      <text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Garden of Earthly Delights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the modern title&amp;nbsp;given to a&amp;nbsp;triptych by the Dutch painter&amp;nbsp;Hieronymus Bosch during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Renaissance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Northern Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;. It has been housed in the&amp;nbsp;Museo del Prado&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Madrid&amp;nbsp;since 1939.

      <text>One of the simplest ways to look at this painting is through Bosch&apos;s use of color.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two of the most prominent:&lt;br&gt;Pink = heavenly/inner influences&lt;br&gt;Blue = Earthly/outer influences</text>

      <text>Birds represent heavenly forces, and having them penetrating the mountain indicates that God penetrates everything and the transcendent nature of God.&lt;br&gt;The blue mountains represent material reality, and the further away they are from the divine the less birds they have. The mountain on the right has no birds touching it. It represents Earth, even sporting it&apos;s own moon.</text>

      <text>This rock formation is actually a human face, the creature with many legs is the eye. And the corrupted earthly influences, mutated creatures crawling out of the water, are crawling into his ear/mind. One has disguised itself in white purity&amp;nbsp;and is studded with&amp;nbsp;pearls which represent lies.&lt;br&gt;The tree growing out of the head&amp;nbsp;represents thought and the serpent curled around it shows that it is already being corrupted. The sprig of branches next to it represents divine influence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The lesson is the that the influences of the divine deteriorate as they interact with the material world.&lt;/i&gt;</text>

      <text>This is the human world where sensual preoccupation dominates and divine energy is corrupted in its contact with the material. &lt;br&gt;The absence of any man-made objects shows that this is not an actual depiction of earth but made to show the sensory world as a distraction from the divine.&amp;nbsp;</text>

      <text>This panel flows in the opposite order of the other two: one descends&amp;nbsp;into hell as one moves upward.&lt;br&gt;The word of God appears again, but it&amp;nbsp;has been corrupted: severed,&amp;nbsp;stabbed through the palm and balancing a die that represents that man plays with God&apos;s words.&lt;br&gt;Eve is now pictured as a drunkard and a gambler.&lt;br&gt;The blindfolded man behind the slab of the tomb is unable to see his inner self. His head is being severed representing that he has lost the connection between&amp;nbsp;mind and body.&lt;br&gt;To the right a man is surrounded by corrupted religious authorities who are attempting to have him sign a contract.&lt;br&gt;You can spot Eve again to the right of the rabbit, where she rests under an earthly queenâlarge with her imagined authority. This time Eve has succumbed to vanity (the ass) and has a mirror in front of her attached to the backside of a demon.</text>

      <text>The large musical instruments represent the justice system created by man and how it is corrupt and a subject of our imagination: in no way reflecting divine justice.&lt;br&gt;Demons balancing books on their heads represent attorneys.&lt;br&gt;The judge (clothed in pink because he thinks he is God) composes the law with his tongue (a string of white pearls/lies)&amp;nbsp;on the butt of a defendant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Here the music has been transcribed and you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://chaoscontrolled123.tumblr.com/post/76305632587/luke-and-i-were-looking-at-hieronymus-boschs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; title=&quot;Link: http://http://chaoscontrolled123.tumblr.com/post/76305632587/luke-and-i-were-looking-at-hieronymus-boschs&quot;&gt;give it a listen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Also, a write up about it from &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/13/hidden-sheet-music-hieronymus-bosch-triptych-recorded&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; title=&quot;Link: http://http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/13/hidden-sheet-music-hieronymus-bosch-triptych-recorded&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.</text>

      <text>Man is made large to represent egotism and viewing ourselves as more important than anything else in the world. This is actually a self portrait of Bosch.&lt;br&gt;To the left a man dangles from a key: will he be able to enter the gates of heaven? He is being weighed.&lt;br&gt;To the right is a knight carrying the purity he believed he had as the white banner, but it is corrupted with the vanity of the toad (which was also seen upon Eve&apos;s breast below). The grail and the pearl represent his attempt to live a noble life, but ultimate failure.</text>
